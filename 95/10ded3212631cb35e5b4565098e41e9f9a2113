patterns for branch list

In this iteration, I have incorporated Jeffs and Junios suggestions and Junios
patches. Thanks!

So:

git branch --list is introduced before the patterns (though it is not needed at
that point)

Multiple patterns are allowed.

The -v/vv/vvv changing patches are gone.

Also, the independent test for "-vv" is put first (which certainly can go in
now).  Next come long option names for "git tag" and "git branch", then the
pattern related patches.

"-l -> -g" migration for "git branch" and such are issues for a later series.
