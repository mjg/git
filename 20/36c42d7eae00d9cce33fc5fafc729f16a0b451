While trying to increase my test run coverage I noticed that most of us won't
run t9119 at all. Bad bad.

My svn is 1.8.11 (r1643975) on Fedora 21.

I would appreciate help with the following items:

TBC = to be confirmed: confirm the svn version where this change kicked it,
or run this patch and t9119 with an svn version other than mine. Please
run with "-v" to make sure only the RFH item fails, see below.

RFH = request for help: I couldn't figure out how to get the working
copy root path in cmd_info.

18 subtests will fail because of the RFH item.
