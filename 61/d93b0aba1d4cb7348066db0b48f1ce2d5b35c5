This patch solves the pruning problem with worktrees, but I feel quite
uneasy about substituting the ref solving at the very heart of refs.c. So
please consider this a mere poc and a request for discussion/input
about how to do this the right way.

I'll cook up a test in proper form, but all you have to do is "worktree
add --detach new" and build a new commit on top of the detached head in
the new worktree. Compare "git prune -n" in "new" and the main worktree...

In essence, I feel the worktree interface still has to evolve a bit: I'd
rather for_each_worktree than loop myself, and if many call sites need to
be aware of multiple heads or worktrees than get_worktrees() should be
part of our init stuff, not here.
