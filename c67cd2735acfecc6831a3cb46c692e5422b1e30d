This changes behavior, yes, but using "git remote show" output for
scripting is crazy anyway...

What bothers me more is the fact that we have 3 different ouput formats because
"git remote -v" is so different from "git remote [-v] show $(git remote)".
But "git remote -v" output is parseable and should stay, whereas "git
remote show" output should be a proper subset of "git remote -v show"
output.
