RFD for several reasons:

- It's incredibly useful, I want it - do others? ;)
- names of the options (let the bikeshedding begin)
- should rev-parse include HEAD?
- tests and doc, of course

rev-parse does not include HEAD even with --all, but rev-list does.
The patch keeps with that tradition (the commit message does not quite
convey this). I don't feel it's a good one. Cleaning that up
requires more work, though.
