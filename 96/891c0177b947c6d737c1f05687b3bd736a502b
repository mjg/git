I'm not sure whether it's worth introducing pretty_ctx.show_source to
keep track of the use of --source. commit->util is possibly used by
other codepaths also. Even without this patch, --cherry-pick --source
does not work (in the sense that there is an empty source output) because
of this.

RFC obviously also so that I don't have to write doc and tests just yet :)
