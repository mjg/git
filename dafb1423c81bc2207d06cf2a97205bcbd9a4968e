I'd actually suggest changing "and -n or -f not given" to "and neither -n nor -f given"
in addition to the above, but the above is a real fix, whereas the latter is a style
issue, and we're close to release.

In fact, having a variable where unset means true is rather unfortunate,
but I don't expect that to be changing.
