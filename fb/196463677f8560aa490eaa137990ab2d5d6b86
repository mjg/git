In fact, there are a few more places where seemingly a req_svn() is missing.
But the call chains are very confusing. The one seemingly missing in prop_walk()
would be covered by the recursive props test which succeeds, so the caller
must have requested SVN::Core also. I believe this applies to the other places
as well (but not to version()).

Is there any harm done by inserting a superfluous req_svn() in these cases for
good measure?
