So, here's a simple patch implementing tilde expansion for git-dir. It passes
all tests. It's done doing the expansion on the setting side.

Alternatively, one might do it on the getting side, i.e. when reading GIT_DIR,
so that paths passed directly through the environment undergo tilde expansion
as well. We don't do this for any environment variable yet, so I didn't go
that far.
