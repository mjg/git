v2 uses the info from refactored wt-status.

The wording is still different:

HEAD detached at %s
* (detached at %s)

for status (line 1) resp. branch (line 2). Maybe it's worthwhile to use the
exact same string so that l10n output is guaranteed to be the same? E.g.

a)
HEAD detached at %s
* (HEAD detached at %s)

or
b)
HEAD (detached at %s)
* (detached at %s)

In case b), "git status" strings would need to change, in case a)
only "git branch" strings which change anyway by this patch.
