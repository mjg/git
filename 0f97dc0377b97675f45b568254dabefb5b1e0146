I am probably making a complete shell fool out of myself by overlooking
something completely trivial.

But just in case I am not, this reduces the loop from O(N^2) to O(N), although
I do admit that N is typically not that large...
(Note that the inner $skp does not overwrite the outer one, at least not with bash.)
