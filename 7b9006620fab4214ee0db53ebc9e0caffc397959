This is RFC/RFD. An actual patch will also adjust several tests to
the new expected output. Also, one might want to change init's default
verbosity level accordingly.

The current output is really confusing for local cloning. There are
several alternative ways to resolve this:
- Make the local cloning process report something.
- Check whether the clone is remote or not and report init or don't.

Currently, we really have two philosophies:
- report only on error
- be chatty on success

I don't think that's a problem, but "simple" commands (e.g. branch, init,
add) should be in the former camp.
