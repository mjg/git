NAME
----
git-glossary - List and translate terms from the glossary

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git glossary' [-a | --all] <term>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Look up each term in the glossary and display it along with its
translation. This works with localised (translated) versions
of git only. 

OPTIONS
-------
<term>...::
	Term(s) to look up.
+
If no term is specified, list all terms from the glossary along with its translation.

-a::
	Look up terms in the message catalogue of all git commands, instead of the glossary.
	This matches with complete english messages only.


DISCUSSION
----------
Unless `-a' is used, partial matches in both english and the translated
entry are shown.

The list of terms is taken from the linkgit:gitglossary[7].
Currently they are:

include::glossary-content.txt[]
