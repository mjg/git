This is RFC for several reasons:

* Should I rename wt-status.c's color() into something more unique when
  I export it?
* Is there any policy regarding use of putchar/puts vs. printf?
* The way it is done now I "color" a space, otherwise one would need to
  break down the print statements even more. Since we always color the
  foreground only it is no problem, is it?
* Even if I were to write tests for status -s: How do I test colors?
