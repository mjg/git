RFC for lack of doc and tests, and also:

I first considered "--cherry-pick A..B" to automatically invoke this mode.
Here are a few reasons why I didn't:

- I haven't found a better way to propagate "we have a fake symmetric
range" from handle_revision_arg() to cherry_pick_list(). Flags like
SHOWN or TMP_MARK are reset somewhere in between! A global wouldn't do a
better (more fine grained) job than the rev flag.

- In the case of multiple revision args, it's probably less confusing to
have one overall mode (think "--cherry-pick A...B C..D") than the added
flexibility.

- I don't like the name "--cherry-pick" for an option which is like "git
cherry" and unlike "git cherry-pick".

- We could till activate this mode as soon as one A..B range apears.
