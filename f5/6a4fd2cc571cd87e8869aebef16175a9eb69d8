rev-list and friends: --min-parents, --max-parents

As opposed to the RFD it replaces, this is a real patch series with
documentation and tests, and it even comes with boiler plate. It should
make all of Jeff's and Junio's dreams come true (as far as revision
limiting by parent number goes).

1/3 introduced the new options (and has a proper commit message)
2/3 I noted along the way and could be applied earlier
3/3 depends on 1 and 2 and is the candy (doc, tests, completion)
