rev-list and friends: --min-parents, --max-parents

In v2, based on the input from Jeff, Junio and Jonathan, I switched to
ordinary signed integers for --min-parent and --max-parent. Negative
parameters to the latter mean infinity. (Thus, no more range/macro magic.)

Also, I optimized the tests and made the structure clearer (hopefully).

Lastly, I rearranged the tests so that the unrelated cleanup comes first.

Based on mg/rev-list-one-side-only (in next) to save Junio a build conflict
resolution.
