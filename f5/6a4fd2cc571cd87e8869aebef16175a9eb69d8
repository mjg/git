rev-list and friends: --min-parents, --max-parents

Compared to what is currently in pu (which is v2+eps), v3 has:

1/3 -> 1/5 unchanged

2/3 -> 2/5 unchanged

3/5 is !squash for 2/5 and introduces --no-min-parents and --no-max-parents
as natural ways to reset the limits

3/3 -> 4/5 with a fix to the notation in documentation (spell out =<number>)
and an additional dodecapus test

5/5 is !fixup for 4/5 and adds test, doc and completion for --no-min-parents
and --no-max-parents

Junio, please let me/us know whether sending an amended series in this way
(which I've seen before) is actually convenient for you or not. !squash
commits require a message edit, for example. OTOH, I don't know any (other?)
good inter diff solution.

Thanks for everyone's input which went into this (Junio, Jeff, Jonathan).
