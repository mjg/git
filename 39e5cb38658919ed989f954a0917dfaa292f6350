v2 changes the wording to match with branch -d and uses the same
for forcefully overwriting tags.

Zolt√°n, I don't think we should make this into a race. Posting in
the relevant thread (and actually following it) would help this.

Also, I think we should really compare the sha1 the tag points to,
i.e. like below and like in your v1 (not v2). Different tag object
is different tag (message may differ, e.g.).
