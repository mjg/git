I would even consider a default of 10 (i.e. show a 20 line stat in full,
abbreviate larger ones) to be sensible but have refrained from such a
behaviour change.

We have hardcoded defaults for width (80) and name-width (50), so having
one for lines should be okay also. Can I has tis wiz default? ;)
