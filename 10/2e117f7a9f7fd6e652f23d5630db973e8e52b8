I would even consider a default of 20 to be sensible but have refrained from
such a behaviour change.

We have hardcoded defaults for width (80) and name-width (50), but - as Junio
points out - typical terminalsi are horizontally limitted, not vertically.

v2 used the name "count" as suggested by Junio and limits to the first <count>
lines/items.

In the case with count+1 items one may argue whether it makes more sense to
ignore the user wish and output all count+1 lines, or count lines (as
requested) plus the "..." line.
