git svn scares me. It exits with 0 even with these problems!
Consequently, the tests in t9116 completely ignore the return codes
because of the pipes.

Patch directly on top of b1b4755. Thanks for the report!

The fix replaces a group "(- )?" by "-? ?" which works in this
case (though not being equivalent). It's easier than dealing
with the problem the grouping introduced.
