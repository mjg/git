I'm not sure about how to best expose this mode:

git stash checkpoint
git stash save --checkpoint

Maybe it is best to document the former and rename "--checkpoint"
to "--no-reset"?

Also, a "safe return" to a checkpoint probably requires

git reset --hard && git stash pop

although "git stash pop" will do in many cases. Should we provide a shortcut
"restore" which does the reset-and-pop?
