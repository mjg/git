RFC also because of lack of doc, and:

Currently, one can do

make -C t t6010-merge-base.sh

or even

make -C t t601*

which is cool but undocumented. If we want this with prove it requires more
effort, or shoving prove into the $(T) target rule which is doable, of course.
I'm just wondering whether it's accepted to introduce a specific rule for prove
at all.
