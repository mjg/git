v2 decorates the HEAD pointing to master as "HEAD->master", a detached
HEAD just as "HEAD". The "->" hopefully conveys the symlink nature - a
"=" would be confusing.

Somehow I still prefer "detached HEAD", dunno. Maybe in addition?

Note that now a checked branch is listed twice, once as target of the
HEAD, once as branch: They are two different refs and colored differently.
