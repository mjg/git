This is on top of the ":path" patch to git-rev-parse.txt.

I chose not to rewrap the paragraphs so that the diff is clearer,
especially with --color-words.

v3 now has the quoting style consistent at least locally (and the caret
spelled out), although the existing text changes style midway.

This is about as far as I will go with a "minimal change" patch trying
to alleviate the :something confusion. I really think the whole part
needs an overhaul not only to make it consistent, so bikeshedding before
that is pointless ;)
