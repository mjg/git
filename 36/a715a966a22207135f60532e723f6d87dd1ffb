So, just so that I don't get the vapor patch award, here's a WIP passing
Jeff's test.

Before looking at free()ing what I've introduced and the binary issue I'll
check whether the whole blob/file read hunk in show_patch_diff() can't be
simply subsumed in the fill_textconv() call. It is almost a copy of
diff_populate_filespec() but not quite.

Also, the situation with worktree is even worse than I thought:

git diff -m produces a combined diff!

Also, my patch does not cure "diff -c" against worktree so far, I'm not
textconv'ing the worktree file yet. But then again, "diff -m" sucks here also.

I'll probably pick this up later today.
