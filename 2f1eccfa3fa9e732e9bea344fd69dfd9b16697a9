While this passes all tests and fixes the described problem, I don't
know about any side effects. Also, I always feel a bit insecure about
simply dropping pointers to allocated memory (remote->url[0]). Should
I free() it? Neither remote-helpers nor memory management are exactly
homeground for me...
