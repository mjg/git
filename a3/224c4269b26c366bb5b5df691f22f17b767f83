v2 does it the --left/right-only way, which I hope is the right way :)

Those new limiters work together with --left-right, --cherry-pick etc.

It could be followed up by introducing --cherry as equivalent to
--cherry-pick --right-only --ignore-merges
and optionally making this work for A..B, or making "--cherry-pick A..B"
invoke "--cherry-pick --right-only A...B" which would make a lot of sense
but also change existing behavior.
