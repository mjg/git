Pseudo revs for refnames

Introduce "ref:foo" to denote the (virtual) refname object for the ref named
"foo". This is handy for now (editing branch and tag notes) but should
become obsoleted by a better ui, such as "git branch --edit foo" or
"git notes --refname edit foo".

Introduce "ref:" as a shortcut to "ref:HEAD" which is the refname object
for the current branch.
