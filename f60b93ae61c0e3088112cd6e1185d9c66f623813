This does not work yet! Work In Progress/Request For Help

"git log -p -m --first-parent" does exactly what I want to achieve,
since the parent rewriting done by "--first-parent" makes "-p -m" output
the diff to the first parent only.

The attached patch teaches format-patch not to ignore merges (on
"--first-parent"), but I failed to track how "diff-tree" sets options
based on "-m" and how to do that for "format-patch". I am sure someone
here can help me!
