This is heavily WIP/RFC for the obvious reasons, but also these:

Currently, multiple --parent options are ORed. I'm still unsure whether that or ANDing
is more useful. ANDing can always be done cheaply by rev-listing with one
--parent and then checking the result commits. ORing, otoh can be achieved only
by doing multiple rev-list runs (unless it is implemented as it is, of course)..

As a consequence (of the decision for ORing), I don't limit automatically by
^<commit>. I should probably do that automatically for the single --parent
option case, it's a huge speed-up.
