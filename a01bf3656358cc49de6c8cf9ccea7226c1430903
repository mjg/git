v2 uses the info from refactored wt-status.

In addition, it tires makes sure that branch and status use the same
strings:

HEAD detached at %s
* (HEAD detached at %s)

(status first line, branch second line)

Unfortunately, status strings are broken into pieces, so this can
be achieved by comments only.
